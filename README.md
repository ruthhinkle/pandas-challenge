# Heroes of Pymoli

## Description
This project analyzes the customers of a fictional game, "Heroes of Pymoli." This analysis breaks down customers into sub-groups based on their reported age and gender. For each sub-group, I examine their average purchase price, total purchase count, total purchase value, and average purchase value per person. 

## Key Analysis
* **Most players are male.** Of the 576 players, 84 of them are male compared to female and other or non-disclosed players. 

* **Young adults are the primary customers.** In fact, 45% of all players are between 20 and 24 years old. On either side of them, adolescent customers (15-19) years old make up 19% of players while older twenties (25-29) make up 13% of players. Combined, these three age groups comprise 77% of the customer population. 

* **Male players account for the majority of revenue but Other / Non-Disclosed players spent more on average per person**  The average total purchase per person for male, female, and other / non-disclosed players was $4.07, $4.47, and $4.56 respectively. If the game company wants to increase revenue, they could try just adding male players for large numbers of small purchases or they might try appealing to non-male players who are likely to spend more.
